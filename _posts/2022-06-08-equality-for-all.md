Happy pride month! Hope everyone is doing well and enjoying their own lives :) And it is okay, if you are not ready <3
I know sometimes it's really hard to live for now and sometimes we just want to get drunk and forget the reality, 
so I want to give you a virtual hug and let you know that it is okay to not be okay.
Nos vemos maÃ±ana ;)
